## Initial spec

P1: The model must comprise people and buildings.

P2: Each person has authorisation to enter certain buildings (and not others). Access to buildings not consigned in this authorization is strictly forbidden. This is a permanent assignment.

P3: At any one moment, a person can only be in one building.

P4: At any one moment, a person must be in at least one building.

P5: Any person in a given building is authorised to be there.

## First refinement

P6: The geometry of buildings serves to define which buildings can communicate between each other, and in which direction.

P7: A building does not communicate with itself.

P8: A person can only go from one building in which he is to another where he desires to go if these two buildings communicate with each other.

P9: No persons must remain blocked in the building.

P10: Any person authorized to be in a building must also be authorized to go in another building which communicates with the first one.

## Remark: P10 implies P9

## Second refinement

P11: The buildings communicate with each other via doors, which are one-way. We there refer to buildings of origin and destination for each door.

P12: A person can only get through a door if it is accepted. A door can only be accepted for one person at a time. Conversely, any person implied in the acceptance of a door cannot do the same of another.

P13: For a door to be accepted for a certain person, this person should be inside the building of origin of that door. Moreover, this person should be authorized to enter the destination building of that same door.

P14: The green light of a door is lit as long as the latter is accepted. As soon as the person has got through, the door blocks itself again. After 30 seconds, if no-one goes through an accepted door, the latter will block automatically. In both cases, the green light goes off.

P15: The red light of a door whose access has just been refused stays on for a period of 2 seconds, the door stays blocked of course.

P16: The red and green lights of a door cannot be lit simultaneously.

P17: Any person is allowed to go through a door which communicates from the building he is to a building in which he is authorized to go. Morever, this person must not be already engaged with another door.
